## Project Motivation
Every year we hear about raging wild fires causing devastating damage to living species and the environment. I wanted to better understand the causes and see if there is some correlation between fires and the pollution level in the atmosphere. I used the Datasets from Kaggle for my analysis.

   **What is the impact on Land (How many and how big across all states?)**
   
   **What are the various Causes of wild fires ?**
   
   **Is there a correlation between fires and air pollution?**
